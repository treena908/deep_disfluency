disfleuncy in a sentence is structured with three parts reparadum, integrenum and repair.




Following tag set is used to label each word:

<e/> - an edit term word, not necessarily inside a repair structure

<rms id=“N”/> - reparandum start word for repair with ID number N (ID indicate the last word index of the reparandum part)

<rm id=“N”/> - mid-reparandum word for repair N

<i id=“N”/> - interregnum word for repair N

<rps id=“N”/> - repair onset word for repair N (where N is normally the 0-indexed position in the sequence)

<rp id=“N”/> - mid-repair word for repair N

<rpnrep id=“N”/> - repair end word for  repetition repair N

<rpndel id=“N”/> - repair end word for a delete repair N
<inc> - label for the last token of the sentence if that utterance to be incomplete Trailing Off (+… )
Remark:
1. phonological fragment, fillers, incomplete words starting with '&' tag with <e/> term not 
necessarily inside a repair structure.
2. Semantic errors [* s]:
s:r related word, target known, as in mother for father
s:ur unrelated word, target known, as in comb for umbrella
s:uk word, unknown target, as in “I go wolf”
s:per perseveration, as in “he kicked the ball through the ball”

but this type error is dfficult to handle as it needs knowledgebase or topic. not including.



We are using same tag as the base paper (EACL'17) excluding one tag.



Example:
word rep. and ret.
1.       and &uh &uh   the [/]    the [//] outside the window there's a path leading to a garage it looks like 
=new_tag: <f> <e> <e> <rms id=4> <rps id=4,rpnrep id=4, rms id=5> <rps id=5, rpndel id=5> ...(rest are fluent)
word and phrase ret.
2.         the &m &uh mother is [//] &um <I'm                                       assuming    it's      a         mother> [//] is stepping in it .
=new_tag:	<f> <f> <e> <f> <rms id=6> <i id=6, e> <rps id=6, rpndel id=6, rms id=11> <rm id=11> <rm id=11><rm id=11><rm id=11> <rps id=11, rpndel=11><f><f><f><f>


Remarks

#In the paper, they have emsasized o repair part accuracy. We need to emphasize on both reparandum and repair.
Will discuss in the meeting. 
#generating this tagset from the model traing our own dataset, 
we can decode word and phrase level rep. and ret. and annotate utterance as per CHAT protocol.
#we will first train the non-incremental disfluency only model on presegmented utterance of transcript.
# for training data, we can use Pitt corpus (all the corpora, fluency task, recall etc) and other talkbank
corpus (lanzi, kemler, depaul), as all of them are annotated with disfluency. that will give us 
~ 1000 transcripts and audio (added detail about the corpus in DB_data_info.txt).

******
need to be changed
1. make another column (cleaned_text_wo_disfluen_marker) where disfluent words will there but not signs.
actual_text: the children are in [/] in short sleeve &um tops and have sandals.
cleaned_text_wo_disfluency_marker: the children are in in short sleeve um tops and have sandals
2. for each column, make another one w/o punctuation. ()
3. remove xxx token. if any utterance is xxx, skip that utterance (count how many utterances are like
that.)
4. some utterance (cleaned_w_disfluency,cleaned_wo_disfluency ) has '+.' symbol. remove that.
5. some utterance has phonological fragment and symbol '/.' like:
she's doesn't &ha +//

cleaned_w/wo disfluency should be like: she's doesn't 
 (remove symbol +//) and phonological fragment &ha.
6. just keep the fillers like (&um, &umm, &uh, &hm, &hmm like these). otherwise anythink starting with 
'&' symbol, remove that.
7. kids are trying to get a &s [x 6] +...
here &s is a phonological fragment. remove it and cleaned text w oe wo disflency would be:
cleaned_text: kids are trying to get a
8.Pitt/Dementia/cookie/018-0.cha
actual_text: &um <they're grading [* s:uk]> [//] &uh they [/] they are going to &um get &uh [x 3] some cookies from the cookie jar . 
cleaned_w_disfluency: &um <they 're grading they are going to &um get &uh &uh &uh [x 3] some cookies from the cookie jar .
'>' symbol of phrase retracing '<they're grading>' is missing.
the cleaned_text_w_disfluency, should be like: &um <they 're grading> &uh they are going to &um get &uh &uh &uh [x 3] some cookies from the cookie jar .
